# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is the OPL Prompts Registry - a collection of powerful, task-specific prompts designed to leverage our entire BSV blockchain development ecosystem. The prompts combine Claude Code capabilities, init-prism project generation, and our extensive toolchain to automate complex workflows.

## Purpose

Create reusable, powerful prompts for:
- **Design & UI Development**: Component libraries, frameworks, design tools
- Project generation and scaffolding
- Report generation and analytics
- Cross-project operations
- Blockchain development workflows
- CI/CD automation
- Code quality and security audits

## Project Context

This repository builds on our monorepo containing:
- **Bitcoin SV Libraries**: go-sdk, bitcoin-auth, bsv-mcp, ordinals tools
- **Applications**: 1sat-api, discord-bot, wallet apps, identity platforms  
- **Development Tools**: agent-master, gib (git+blockchain), init-prism
- **Infrastructure**: MCP servers, overlay services, authentication systems

## Prompt Categories

- Transaction monitoring
- Ordinals management
- Token operations
- Identity management

### 5. Infrastructure
- Performance monitoring
- Backup verification
- Configuration management

## Directory Structure and Usage

**CRITICAL**: Understand the difference between repository-specific and distributable content:

### `.claude/` Directory (Repository-Specific)
- **Purpose**: Contains commands and settings ONLY for working on the prompts repository itself
- **Example**: `.claude/commands/init-agents.md` - helps manage agents within this repo
- **When to use**: Only place files here if they are specifically for maintaining/developing the prompts repository

### `user/.claude/` Directory (For Distribution)
- **Purpose**: Contains commands, agents, and hooks to be distributed to end users
- **Example**: `user/.claude/commands/opl/mcp/install-magic.md` - users will copy this to their `~/.claude/`
- **When to use**: Place ALL commands/agents/hooks here that users should have access to across their projects
- **Contents**: 
  - `commands/opl/` - OPL organization commands with category subdirectories
  - `agents/` - Specialized AI sub-agents
  - `hooks/` - Automation hooks for workflow enhancement

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ‚ùå NEVER put general-purpose agents in `.claude/agents/` 
- ‚ùå NEVER put user commands in `.claude/commands/`
- ‚ùå NEVER put shareable hooks in `.claude/hooks/`
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS put distributable content in `user/.claude/`
- ‚úÖ ONLY put repo maintenance tools in `.claude/`

## Development Notes

- Each prompt should be self-contained and executable
- Include error handling and validation
- Document required permissions and dependencies
- Test prompts thoroughly before committing
- Keep prompts focused on specific, repeatable tasks

## Agent Color Scheme

Our specialized agents use a consistent color scheme for easy identification:
- üîµ **Blue** - prompt-engineer (command creation)
- üü£ **Purple** - design-specialist (UI/UX)
- üü¢ **Green** - integration-expert (APIs)
- üü† **Orange** - mcp-specialist (MCP servers)
- üü° **Yellow** - bitcoin-specialist (BSV)
- üî¥ **Red** - code-auditor (security)
- üî∑ **Cyan** - documentation-writer (docs)
- ü©∑ **Pink** - research-specialist (info gathering)

## Command Versioning

All commands now include version tracking:
- Version in frontmatter (e.g., `version: 1.0.0`)
- Use `/version-check` to check for updates
- Auto-generated registry tracks all versions

## InitPRISM Integration

**POWERFUL RECURSIVE CAPABILITY**: InitPRISM now has access to this prompts repository, creating advanced automation possibilities:

### Self-Referential Prompting
- **Project Generation**: InitPRISM can reference existing prompts when generating new projects
- **Prompt Composition**: Combine multiple prompts for complex workflows
- **Template Enhancement**: Use prompts as templates for project-specific automation

### Advanced Workflows
```bash
# InitPRISM can now do things like:
# 1. Generate a new project
# 2. Reference development prompts for automated workflows
# 3. Apply design prompts for UI consistency
# 4. Use infrastructure prompts for deployment automation
```

### Prompt Evolution
- **Meta-Prompts**: Create prompts that generate other prompts
- **Ecosystem Awareness**: New projects can inherit best practices from existing prompts
- **Automated Integration**: Projects generated with awareness of our automation patterns

### Best Practices for InitPRISM Integration
1. **Reference Relevant Prompts**: When generating projects, consider which prompts apply
2. **Document Prompt Usage**: Include instructions on which prompts to use for maintenance
3. **Create Prompt Chains**: Design workflows that leverage multiple prompts sequentially
4. **Build Prompt-Aware Templates**: Templates that reference specific prompts for common tasks

## Common Commands

### Registry Management
```bash
# Update the prompt registry after adding/modifying prompts
./scripts/generate-registry.sh

# View registry statistics
cat registry.json | jq '.statistics'

# Search prompts by tag
cat registry.json | jq '.prompts[] | select(.tags[] | contains("blockchain"))'
```

### Repository Maintenance Commands

When working in this prompts repository, you have access to these management commands:

#### Prompts Management
- `/opl:prompts:help` - Show comprehensive help for repository management
- `/opl:prompts:init` - Initialize user commands (copy from `user/.claude/commands/opl/` to `~/.claude/commands/opl/`)
- `/opl:prompts:sync` - Synchronize commands between repository and user directory (pull/push/status)

#### Agents Management  
- `/opl:agents:init` - Install specialized agents to `~/.claude/agents/`
  - First time setup copies all agents
  - Use `--list` to preview, `--force` to overwrite
- `/opl:agents:sync` - Update agents between repository and local
  - Check status, pull updates, or contribute improvements back

#### Hooks Management
- `/opl:hooks:init` - Install automation hooks to `~/.claude/hooks/`
- `/opl:hooks:sync` - Update hook definitions between repo and local

#### Registry Management
- `/opl:registry:version` - Check command versions and find updates
- `/opl:registry:update` - Auto-generate registry.json after adding/modifying prompts
- `/opl:registry:publish` - Prepare repository for publishing (final checks)

**Important**: These commands are only available when working in the prompts repository itself. They help maintain and distribute the OPL command ecosystem.

## Prompt Creation Guidelines

When creating new prompts or commands:
1. **Metadata First**: Always include complete YAML frontmatter with version, description, and tags
2. **Self-Contained**: Each prompt should work independently without external dependencies
3. **Clear Mission**: Start with a clear mission statement of what the prompt accomplishes
4. **Structured Format**: Follow the established sections (Mission, Core Capabilities, etc.)
5. **Practical Examples**: Include real-world usage examples

## Directory Architecture

### Content Organization
- **Prompts** go in category directories (design/, development/, infrastructure/)
- **User commands** go in `user/.claude/commands/opl/` with category subdirectories
- **Repository commands** go in `.claude/commands/` (maintenance only)
- **Agents** go in `user/.claude/agents/` for distribution
- **Hooks** go in `user/.claude/hooks/` for automation

### Namespace Convention for Commands
Commands use a three-part namespace to avoid conflicts:
- **Format**: `/organization:category:command`
- **Example**: `/opl:utils:find` or `/opl:dev:lint`

OPL command categories:
- `opl:utils:` - General utilities (find, search)
- `opl:dev:` - Development tools (lint, enhance)
- `opl:design:` - Design and UI tools
- `opl:docs:` - Documentation generation
- `opl:integrations:` - Third-party integrations
- `opl:mcp:` - Model Context Protocol servers

## Testing Prompts

Before committing new prompts:
1. Test with Claude Code directly
2. Verify all required tools are specified
3. Check that examples produce expected output
4. Run through the prompt end-to-end
5. Update registry with `./scripts/generate-registry.sh`
