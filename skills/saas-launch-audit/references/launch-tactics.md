# SaaS Launch Tactics

## The "Magic Triangle" Strategy

A coordinated approach using three channels:

### 1. Founder Content
- Personal stories on LinkedIn/X
- Behind-the-scenes building journey
- Lessons learned and insights
- Authentic, not polished marketing

### 2. Outreach
- Direct DMs to potential customers
- Community engagement (genuine, not spammy)
- Podcast appearances
- Guest posts on relevant blogs

### 3. Retargeting
- Capture visitors with retargeting pixels
- Show ads to people who visited but didn't convert
- Sequential messaging based on pages visited
- Coordinate timing with content pushes

## Product Hunt Launch

### Verified 2026 Statistics

- **26.5%** of launches attract 500-1,000 users
- **22.4%** gain 1,000-2,000 users
- **50%** of founders report some increase in registrations
- **30%** experience significant increase
- **56%** rated experience as "very satisfied"
- **49%** fail by relying on Product Hunt alone

**Expected ROI:** 5,000 visits → 100 trials (2% conversion) → 20 customers (20% trial-to-paid) = $10,000 ARR at $500 ACV

**Reality Check:** Conversion rates vary 20-50% based on ICP fit and market alignment. Product Hunt works best as part of a broader launch strategy.

### Pre-Launch Preparation (2-4 weeks before)

**Build Your Hunter Network:**
- Identify potential hunters with 1000+ followers
- Reach out with personalized messages
- Share early access for feedback
- Don't ask to be hunted directly (let relationship develop)

**Supporter Strategy (400-500+ target):**
1. Export contacts from LinkedIn, email, communities
2. Craft personalized DM template (video DMs have near 100% open rate)
3. Send 50-100 DMs per day for 2 weeks
4. Ask for support commitment, not immediate action
5. Create a Notion/spreadsheet to track commitments
6. Focus on warm outreach - people who know you are more likely to support

**Target Benchmarks:**
- ~1,000 upvotes for Product of the Day (high confidence)
- ~2,000 upvotes for Product of the Month
- Need 20-50 upvotes/comments in first hour to trigger algorithm

**2026 Challenge:** Manual homepage featuring has gotten "ruthlessly selective" - getting featured is harder than ever.

**Prepare Assets:**
- Product thumbnail (240x240)
- Gallery images (1270x760)
- Compelling tagline (60 chars max)
- First comment with your story
- Maker video (optional but recommended)

### Launch Day

**Timing:**
- Launch at 12:01 AM PT for full day visibility
- Have team ready for comments
- Schedule social posts throughout day

**Engagement:**
- Respond to every comment within 1 hour
- Thank supporters publicly
- Share behind-the-scenes updates
- Don't ask for upvotes (against TOS)

**Avoid:**
- Asking for upvotes in DMs
- Voting from same IP/device clusters
- Fake accounts or vote rings
- Excessive self-promotion

### Post-Launch
