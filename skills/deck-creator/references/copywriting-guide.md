# Copywriting Principles for Decks

## The One Message Rule

**Every slide must have ONE clear takeaway.**

If you can't summarize the slide in one sentence, split it.

**Bad:**
```
Our platform has analytics, reporting, dashboards, 
exports, scheduling, and team collaboration features.
```

**Good:**
```
Headline: "See everything in one dashboard"
Visual: Clean dashboard screenshot
```

---

## Headline Writing

**Headlines should tell the story on their own.**

Someone scanning just the headlines should understand your entire pitch.

### Headline Formulas

**Problem/Solution:**
- "[Problem] costs companies $X/year"
- "[Product] eliminates [pain point]"

**Benefit-Focused:**
- "Cut [metric] by [percentage]"
- "The fastest way to [outcome]"

**Differentiation:**
- "[Product]: [Category] without [common pain]"
- "Finally, [benefit] without [tradeoff]"

**Curiosity:**
- "Why [group] are switching to [product]"
- "The [adjective] approach to [activity]"

### Headline Checklist

- [ ] Under 8 words
- [ ] Contains a verb
- [ ] Specific, not generic
- [ ] Couldn't apply to any competitor
- [ ] Creates interest or emotion

## Show, Don't Tell

**Replace text with visuals whenever possible.**

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "Easy to use" | Screenshot of simple interface |
| "Fast performance" | Speed comparison chart |
| "Many integrations" | Logo grid |
| "Great support" | Quote from customer |
| "Secure" | Security badge/certification |

### The 6-Second Test

Can someone understand the slide in 6 seconds?
- 1 second: Get the headline
- 2-3 seconds: Process the visual
- 4-6 seconds: Read supporting text

If not, simplify.

## Concrete > Abstract

**Specific claims beat vague superlatives.**

**Bad:**
- "Best-in-class solution"
- "Industry-leading performance"
- "Significant time savings"
- "Many happy customers"

**Good:**
- "3x faster than [competitor]"
- "Save 10 hours/week"
- "Used by 500+ teams at companies like [logos]"
- "4.9/5 rating from 200+ reviews"

### The Specificity Ladder

1. **Vague:** "Saves time"
2. **Better:** "Saves 5 hours/week"
3. **Best:** "Engineers at Stripe save 5 hours/week on documentation"

---

## Problem → Solution → Proof Structure

**Classic persuasion framework for any pitch:**

### 1. Problem (Make it hurt)
- Specific pain point
- Quantified cost/impact
- Emotional hook

### 2. Solution (Present clearly)
- What you do (one sentence)
- How it works (3 steps max)
- Key differentiator

### 3. Proof (Remove doubt)
- Customer quote
- Metrics/traction
- Social proof

**Example Flow:**
```
Slide 1: "Manual data entry costs teams 15 hours/week"
Slide 2: "AutoSync connects your tools automatically"
Slide 3: "500+ teams save 10+ hours/week"
```

---

## End with Action

**Every deck needs a clear next step.**

**Weak endings:**
- "Thank you"
- "Questions?"
- "That's our presentation"

**Strong endings:**
- "Start your free trial: [link]"
- "Book a demo: [calendar link]"
- "Join 500+ teams: [signup button]"

### CTA Best Practices

1. **One primary action** - Don't offer 5 options
2. **Make it easy** - Link, QR code, or clear instruction
3. **Create urgency** - "Limited beta spots" or "Launch pricing"
4. **Repeat contact info** - Even if it's elsewhere

---

## Voice and Tone Guidelines

### Active Voice

**Passive:** "Data is processed by our system"
**Active:** "Our system processes your data"

### Second Person (You)

**Company-focused:** "We help teams collaborate"
**Customer-focused:** "You collaborate seamlessly with your team"

### Confidence Without Arrogance

**Arrogant:** "We're the best platform in the world"
**Confident:** "The platform 500+ teams rely on"

**Hedging:** "We think we might possibly help..."
**Confident:** "Teams using [Product] save 10 hours/week"

## Editing Checklist

Before finalizing deck copy:

- [ ] Headlines tell the story alone
- [ ] Every claim is specific (numbers > adjectives)
- [ ] No jargon without explanation
- [ ] Active voice throughout
- [ ] Customer-focused ("you" not "we")
- [ ] Each slide has one clear message
- [ ] 6-second test passed on every slide
- [ ] Clear CTA on final slide
- [ ] Proofread for typos
- [ ] Read aloud - does it flow?

## Common Copy Mistakes

### 1. Feature Dumping
**Wrong:** Listing every feature
**Right:** Leading with outcomes

### 2. Jargon Overload
**Wrong:** Technical terms without context
**Right:** Simple language with technical proof available

### 3. Weak Differentiation
**Wrong:** "We're better than competitors"
**Right:** "Unlike [competitor], we [specific difference]"

### 4. Missing Proof
**Wrong:** Making claims without evidence
**Right:** Every claim backed by data or quote

### 5. Passive Ending
**Wrong:** "Thank you for your time"
**Right:** "Start your free trial today"
