# Copywriting Principles for Presentations

Marketing and copywriting principles for creating compelling slide content.

## Core Principles

### 1. One Message Per Slide

Each slide communicates exactly one idea. If you need to make two points, use two slides.

**Test**: Can you summarize the slide in one sentence?

**Bad**: "Our platform offers security, scalability, compliance, and great UX"
**Good**: "Bank-grade security protects every transaction"

### 2. Headlines Tell the Story

Someone should understand the entire deck by reading only the headlines.

**Bad Headlines** (Vague):
- "About Us"
- "Features"
- "Next Steps"

**Good Headlines** (Story):
- "We've Helped 50+ Banks Modernize"
- "Three Capabilities That Set Us Apart"
- "Your Path to Launch in 8 Weeks"

### 3. Show Don't Tell

Replace text walls with visuals, stats, and diagrams.

**Instead of**: "Our process is efficient and streamlined"
**Show**: Process diagram with timing

**Instead of**: "Customers love us"
**Show**: Quote + photo + company logo

### 4. Concrete > Abstract

Specific numbers beat vague claims.

**Abstract**: "Fast settlement"
**Concrete**: "Settlement in 2.3 seconds"

**Abstract**: "Significant savings"
**Concrete**: "85% reduction in fees"

**Abstract**: "Many customers"
**Concrete**: "47 enterprise clients"

### 5. Problem → Solution → Proof

Classic persuasion structure that works:

1. **Problem**: Establish pain they're feeling
2. **Solution**: Present your answer
3. **Proof**: Show it works (data, testimonials, case studies)

### 6. End with Action

Never end on information. End on action.

**Bad Ending**: "Thank you for your time"
**Good Ending**: "Schedule your demo call this week"

## Headline Formulas

### The Transformation
"From [Current State] to [Desired State]"

Examples:
- "From 3-Day Settlement to Instant"
- "From Manual Compliance to Automated"

### The Promise
"[Benefit] Without [Pain]"

Examples:
- "Global Reach Without Legacy Complexity"
- "Compliance Without the Paperwork"

### The Challenge
"What If [Provocative Question]?"

Examples:
- "What If Settlement Could Be Instant?"
- "What If Compliance Was Built-In?"

### The Proof
"[Number] [Results] in [Timeframe]"

Examples:
- "50+ Banks Onboarded in 18 Months"
- "$2B Settled in First Quarter"

### The Comparison
"[X] [Metric] vs. [Y] [Metric]"

Examples:
- "3 Days vs. 3 Seconds"
- "15% Fees vs. 0.5%"

## Writing for Scanning

Presentation audiences scan, they don't read. Optimize for scanning.

### Visual Hierarchy
1. **Headline**: Largest, boldest (the takeaway)
2. **Subhead**: Supporting context
3. **Body points**: Scannable bullets
4. **Fine print**: Details for those who want them

### Bullet Best Practices
- Start each bullet with action verb or benefit
- Keep bullets parallel in structure
- Maximum 4-6 bullets per slide
- Use sentence fragments, not full sentences

**Parallel Structure**:
- ✅ "Faster settlement. Lower costs. Better compliance."
- ❌ "Settlement is faster. It costs less. Compliance is improved."

### Word Economy
Cut ruthlessly. Every word must earn its place.

**Before**: "Our platform provides users with the ability to"
**After**: "Users can"

**Before**: "Due to the fact that"
**After**: "Because"

**Before**: "At this point in time"
**After**: "Now"

## Emotional Triggers

Decisions are emotional, justified rationally. Use both.

### Fear of Loss (FOMO)
- "Your competitors are already using this"
- "Every day of delay costs $X"
- "The regulatory deadline is approaching"

### Desire for Gain
- "Unlock new revenue streams"
- "Become the market leader"
- "Delight your customers"

### Social Proof
- "Join 50+ banks who trust us"
- "Recommended by industry analysts"
- "Chosen by leading fintechs"

### Authority
- "Certified by [Authority]"
- "Our team includes former [Impressive Role]"
- "Patent-pending technology"

### Urgency
- "Limited pilot program"
- "Q1 implementation slots available"
- "Early adopter pricing ends [Date]"

## Audience-Specific Framing

### For Executives (C-Suite)
- Lead with outcomes and ROI
- Talk about competitive advantage
- Focus on strategy, not tactics
- Keep it high-level

**Language**: "Strategic advantage", "Market position", "Revenue growth"

### For Technical Leaders (CTO/VP Eng)
- Lead with architecture and capabilities
- Talk about integration and scalability
- Focus on how, not just what
- Include technical credibility markers

**Language**: "API-first", "99.99% uptime", "Horizontal scaling"

### For Finance Leaders (CFO)
- Lead with costs and savings
- Talk about risk mitigation
- Focus on ROI and payback period
- Include compliance benefits

**Language**: "TCO reduction", "Risk-adjusted returns", "Audit-ready"

### For Operations Leaders

- Include support and training

**Language**: "Streamlined workflow", "Reduced manual effort", "24/7 support"

## Persuasion Patterns

### Before/After
Show the transformation your solution creates.

```
BEFORE: [Current painful state]
AFTER: [Desired state with your solution]
```

### Problem/Agitate/Solve
1. **Problem**: State the pain
2. **Agitate**: Make it worse (cost of inaction)
3. **Solve**: Present your solution

### Feature/Benefit/Proof
For each feature:
1. **Feature**: What it does
2. **Benefit**: Why it matters
3. **Proof**: Evidence it works

Example:
- **Feature**: Real-time settlement
- **Benefit**: No more waiting 3 days for funds
- **Proof**: $2B settled in <3 seconds average

## Content Gathering Questions

Ask these to extract compelling content from stakeholders:

### Understanding the Audience
- Who will be in the room?
- What do they already know about us?
- What's their biggest concern?
- What would make this a "yes" for them?

### Understanding the Problem
- What's not working today?
- What does this problem cost them?
- How have they tried to solve it before?
- Why hasn't anything worked?

### Understanding the Solution
- What do we do differently?
- Why should they choose us over alternatives?
- What proof do we have that this works?
- What makes this the right time?

### Understanding the Ask
- What do we want them to do?
- What's the next step after this meeting?
- What timeline are we proposing?
- What's the investment required?

## Common Mistakes

### 1. Feature Focus Instead of Benefit Focus
**Feature**: "256-bit encryption"
**Benefit**: "Your data stays private, always"

### 2. Inside-Out Thinking
**Inside-out**: "We're proud of our technology"
**Outside-in**: "You get faster, cheaper transfers"

### 3. Jargon Overload
**Jargony**: "Leveraging our proprietary ML-driven solution"
**Clear**: "Our system learns and improves automatically"

### 4. No Clear Hierarchy
Every slide needs one main point. Everything else supports it.

### 5. Burying the Lead
Put the most important information first. Don't make them wait.

### 6. Weak Call to Action
**Weak**: "Contact us for more information"
**Strong**: "Schedule your demo call this week: [link]"
