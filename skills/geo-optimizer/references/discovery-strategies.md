# Discovery Strategies by Site Age

How site maturity affects AI visibility and optimal strategies.

## The Discovery Gap

Research reveals a dramatic visibility gap between new and established sites:

| Site Age | AI Visibility | Traditional SEO Visibility |
|----------|--------------|---------------------------|
| <6 months | ~1% | ~5% |
| 6-24 months | ~3.3% | ~25% |
| 2-5 years | ~60% | ~70% |
| 5+ years | ~99% | ~95% |

**Key insight:** Startups face a 30:1 visibility disadvantage in AI search compared to established domains.

## Why the Gap Exists

### Knowledge Cutoff Problem

LLMs have training data cutoffs:
- ChatGPT: Trained on data up to certain date
- Claude: Similar knowledge cutoff
- Perplexity: Combines knowledge base + real-time search

New sites simply don't exist in the training data of knowledge-based models.

### Domain Authority Signals

AI systems weight traditional authority signals:
- Backlink profiles
- Brand mentions across the web
- Social proof (Reddit discussions, Twitter mentions)
- Historical content presence

New sites lack these accumulated signals.

### The "Recency Wall"

For knowledge-based queries (not real-time search):
- New entities hit a wall of invisibility
- No amount of GEO optimization helps
- Must wait for training data updates OR
- Must focus on web-augmented strategies

## Strategy by Site Age

### Tier 1: Brand New (<6 months)

**Primary focus:** Web-augmented signals, not GEO content

#### Actions
1. **Build Reddit presence**
   - Participate in relevant subreddits
   - Share genuinely helpful content
   - Build organic mentions

2. **Earn referring domains**
   - Guest posts on established sites
   - HARO responses
   - Open source contributions with backlinks

3. **Social proof accumulation**
   - Twitter/X discussions mentioning brand
   - LinkedIn thought leadership
   - YouTube content with brand mentions

4. **Technical foundation**
   - Implement AgentFacts now (future-proofing)
   - Ensure site is crawlable
   - Build content library for later

#### Don't Waste Time On
- Hedge density optimization (no one's citing you yet)
- Advanced GEO tactics
- AI-specific content optimization

### Tier 2: Early Stage (6-24 months)

**Primary focus:** Hybrid approach - web signals + basic GEO

#### Actions
1. **Continue web-augmented signals**
   - Double down on what's working
   - Track referral domain growth

2. **Begin GEO optimization**
   - Audit hedge density on key pages
   - Ensure technical visibility
   - Implement schema markup

3. **Content authority building**
   - Publish definitive guides
   - Create citable resources
   - Build entity density

4. **Monitor AI visibility**
   - Search for brand in ChatGPT/Perplexity
   - Track citation appearances
   - Note which content gets cited

### Tier 3: Established (2-5 years)

**Primary focus:** Full GEO optimization

#### Actions
1. **Comprehensive GEO audit**
   - Hedge density across all content
   - Technical visibility optimization
   - Entity density improvement

2. **AgentFacts implementation**
   - Full NANDA protocol setup
   - Endpoint configuration
   - Trust certification

3. **Content refresh**
   - Update older content with confident language
   - Add citations and specifics
   - Remove outdated hedging

4. **Competitive analysis**
   - How do competitors appear in AI search?
   - What content gets cited?
   - Identify citation opportunities

### Tier 4: Authority (5+ years)

**Primary focus:** Maintaining and defending position

#### Actions
1. **Citation monitoring**
   - Track AI citations
   - Identify misattributions
   - Correct inaccuracies

2. **Advanced GEO tactics**
   - Predictive content (what will LLMs need?)
   - Structured data for AI consumption
   - API endpoints for agents

3. **Trust optimization**
   - Third-party certifications
   - Audit trails
   - Transparency reports

4. **Innovation**
   - Early adoption of new protocols
   - Participation in AI standards
   - Direct LLM partnerships

## Web-Augmented vs Knowledge-Based Queries

### Knowledge-Based Queries
Answered from training data:
- "What is [concept]?"
- "How does [technology] work?"
- "Compare [A] vs [B]"

**For these:** Site must exist in training data

### Web-Augmented Queries
Answered with real-time search:
- "Best [product] in 2025"
- "Recent [topic] news"
- "[Brand] reviews"

**For these:** Current web signals matter

### Strategy Implications

| Query Type | New Sites | Established Sites |
|------------|-----------|-------------------|
| Knowledge-based | Invisible | Optimize content |
| Web-augmented | Target these | Dominate both |

## Measuring Progress

### Early Stage Metrics (0-24 months)
- Referring domain count
- Reddit mention volume
- Social media brand mentions
- First AI citation appearance

### Growth Stage Metrics (2-5 years)
- AI citation frequency
- Query coverage (which queries cite you?)
- Hedge density scores
- AgentFacts validation

### Authority Stage Metrics (5+ years)
- Citation accuracy
- Market share of AI visibility
- Competitive citation ratio
- New protocol adoption rate

## Case Studies

### Startup Success Pattern
1. **Month 1-3:** Reddit engagement, HARO responses
2. **Month 4-6:** First referring domains, social mentions
3. **Month 7-12:** Basic GEO implementation
4. **Month 13-18:** First AI citations appear
5. **Month 19-24:** Meaningful AI visibility

### Established Site Optimization
1. **Week 1:** Full GEO audit
2. **Week 2-3:** Hedge density remediation
3. **Week 4:** AgentFacts implementation
4. **Month 2:** Content refresh cycle
5. **Month 3:** Citation monitoring begins

## Common Mistakes

### New Sites
- Obsessing over GEO when invisible anyway
- Ignoring web-augmented signals
- Expecting quick AI visibility
- Not building foundation for future

### Established Sites
- Assuming SEO = GEO
- Not auditing hedge density
- Ignoring AgentFacts
- Resting on domain authority

## Action Plan Template

### For New Sites
```
[ ] Set up Reddit presence in 3 relevant subreddits
[ ] Create HARO account and respond to 5 queries/week
[ ] Implement basic AgentFacts (minimal schema)
[ ] Build 10 high-quality content pieces
[ ] Track referring domain growth monthly
[ ] Monitor for first AI citation
```

### For Established Sites
```
[ ] Run full GEO audit
[ ] Remediate top 10 pages for hedge density
[ ] Implement complete AgentFacts
[ ] Refresh content older than 2 years
[ ] Set up AI citation monitoring
[ ] Plan quarterly GEO reviews
```

## Timeline Expectations

| Milestone | New Site | Established Site |
|-----------|----------|------------------|
| First AI mention | 12-18 months | Already there |
| Regular citations | 24-36 months | 3-6 months |
| AI visibility parity | 36-48 months | 6-12 months |
| Authority status | 5+ years | 1-2 years |

**Remember:** These are typical timelines. Quality content, strong web signals, and consistent effort can accelerate progress.
