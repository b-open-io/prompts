# Contributing to the OPL Prompts Repository

Thank you for contributing! This guide will help you add new prompts to our collection.

## üìã Before You Begin

1. **Check Existing Prompts**: Browse the directories to avoid duplicates
2. **Test Your Prompt**: Ensure it works with Claude Code
3. **Keep It Simple**: Focus on useful content, not complex metadata

## üìù Creating a New Prompt

### 1. Choose the Right Category

Place your prompt in the appropriate directory:
- `design/` - UI/UX frameworks and design tools
- `development/` - Code and dependency workflows
- `infrastructure/` - DevOps and deployment

### 2. Use Simple Frontmatter

Create your prompt file with minimal YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Prompt Title"
description: "Brief description of what this prompt does"
---

# Your Prompt Title

[Your prompt content here...]
```

That's all you need! Focus on writing clear, useful prompts.
