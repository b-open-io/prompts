## Advanced Usage

### Working with Agents

Agents can be explicitly requested for specific tasks:

```
"Use the prompt-engineer agent to create a deployment command"
"Have the bitcoin-specialist review this transaction builder"
"Ask the design-specialist about component library best practices"
```

### Chaining Commands

If you use OPL commands, you can chain them for complex workflows. See that repository for details.

### Custom Workflows

Create project-specific automation by combining:
1. Specialized agents for expertise
2. Slash commands for automation
3. Hooks for background tasks
4. Prompts for complex operations

## Common Use Cases

### Starting a New Project
```bash
# Use init-prism with our prompts
init-prism create my-app --template bitcoin-auth

# Set up integrations
/opl:integrations:auth
/opl:integrations:stripe
```

### Code Quality
```bash
# Audit and fix code
/opl:dev:lint
"Ask the code-auditor to review security"
```

### Documentation
```bash
# Generate comprehensive docs
/opl:docs:prd "Project Name"
"Have the documentation-writer create a README"
```
